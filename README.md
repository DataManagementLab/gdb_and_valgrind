# Tutorial for GDB and Valgrind
This repository should serve as an introduction for using GDB and Valgrind.
It is heavily inspired by [Tutorial: Introduction to Valgrind](https://github.com/rodrigorandel/introduction_to_valgrind) from [Rodrigo Alves Randel](https://github.com/rodrigorandel).
As it is an evolving repo, feel free to leave feedback as issues.
